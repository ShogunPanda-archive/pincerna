A bunch of useful Alfred 2 workflows.

## Installation

### Preparation of the environment

#### Users of MacOSX Mavericks

On OSX Mountain Lion (10.9), the default Ruby version is 2.0.0, so no additional steps are required.

#### Users of MacOSX Mountain Lion and older

On OSX Mountain Lion (10.8) and older, the default Ruby version is 1.8.7.

This version is really older and no longer maintained. Pincerna requires at least Ruby 1.9 and works on 2.0 too.

The scripts support using [rvm](https://rvm.io/) for loading a new Ruby version. To install, check its documentation. In short, it should resolv to these steps:

    \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | sudo bash -s stable
    rvm install [1.9.3|2.0.0]
    rvm use [1.9.3|2.0.0] --default

### Installation of the gem and the workflow

    gem i pincerna
    pincerna install

## Uninstallation

    pincerna uninstall
    pincerna quit
    gem uni pincerna

## Usage

Pincerna supports many shortcut which will save your work. Here's the comprehensive list.

### Unit conversion

* `c 123.45 $FROM_UNIT to $TO_UNIT`

`to` can be omitted. Actioning on the result will copy the result to the clipboard.

If `with rate` is appended, also the conversion rate will be copied as well.

If `split units` is appended, the value in feet will be shown in `X ft Y in` form, pounds (lbs) or ounces (oz) will be shown in `X lbs Y oz` form.

Examples:

  * `convert 123.45 m to m`
  * `c 123 kg oz with rate split units`

## Contributing to pincerna
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
